# Kubernetes programming examples

This repo is a place for me to collect small snippets of code targeting a
specific task each, i.e. simple controllers, API clients etc.

## What you'll find here

The examples are split based on the library used:

* [controller-runtime](controller-runtime/): Examples making use of
  [sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime).
* [client-go](client-go/): Examples making use of
  [k8s.io/client-go](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go).
